# Rust-Projects
You'll need to install rust before running. Follow the instructions [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

## Running a project
Extract the `projects.7z` file. Then, navigate into the rust folder in your terminal. Then run the command `cargo run`. I can't guarantee this works on Windows or MacOS—I don't know how either of them work—but this is how you do it Linux.
